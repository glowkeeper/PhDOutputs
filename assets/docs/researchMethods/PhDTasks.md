## The Tasks Needed to Complete My PhD

The tasks needed to complete my PhD, which I am going to describe below, are drawn from the pseudo code given for the scientific approach in my research methods report. Namely:

    while [PhD]
    do
      Ask a question
        Why is the question relevant?
        Perform a literature review
      Frame a hypothesis
        Base the hypothesis on specific literature
        Express it in terms of the operations used for proof
      Derive a prediction and create the technology
        Build models and prototypes
      Gather evidence
        Create and run an experiment, making observations
        Test the technology
      Evaluate the hypothesis against evidence
        Interpret results for validity and scope
      Disseminate findings
    done

I will add to those tasks the assertion that I intend to publish papers as often as possible. 

I am going to take the agile approach to listing the tasks, in as much as I am not going to estimate how long each of these tasks may take, but rather, the jobs listed are substantial, and as I complete them, I shall record how long they took. 

1. Complete the paper I am writing on the digitisation of central bank currencies, which is based on the 'Leftover Currency' blockchain example I have already coded. 
2. Ask the Question.
    + Describe the relevance of the question I've asked, namely: "Are Blockchain Systems the Basis Upon Which People Can Easily Interact With Distant Strangers and Collaborate at Scale?"
    + Perform a literature review
        + Include the social and ethical aspects of my research, not just the technological.
3. Frame a Hypothesis.
    + Refine my hypothesis after reviewing the relevant literature. My hypothesis is currently: "Although blockchains may provide the technical basis upon which people could easily interact with distant strangers and collaborate at scale, there are significant social, ethical, and political barriers to their adoption."
    + Write a paper after reviewing the literature specific to my hypothesis.
    + Define the operations I am going to use to prove (or disprove) my hypothesis.
4. Derive a prediction and create the technology.
    + Use open source tools to code a working example of the technology that underpins my research question.
    + Write a paper about my experience of coding the technology that underpins my research question.
5. Gather evidence.
    + Create experiments and make observations.    
    + Test the technology.
    + Write a paper based on those observations and the test results obtained.
6. Evaluate the hypothesis against evidence.
    + Interpret results for validity and scope.
    + Write a paper on that interpretation.
7. Write papers
    + If, during my PhD, I have any other ideas for completing papers on my work, I will write them up and try and get them published.
8. Disseminate Findings
    + Write up my thesis.

To ensure that I complete those tasks in the project-oriented approach alluded to in my research methods report, I am going to use the tool Trello to create Kanban Boards, which my Supervisor and I will be able to use to monitor my progress.
