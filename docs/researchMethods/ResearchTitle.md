# Are Blockchain Systems the Basis Upon Which People Can Easily Interact With Distant Strangers and Collaborate at Scale?

Bitcoin (BTC) is a form of electronic cash that is referred to as cryptocurrency because it relies on cryptography. Blockchain is the technology underpinning BTC; it provides an immutable database, or public ledger, of every BTC transaction that has ever taken place. However, a blockchain has capabilities far beyond any standard database because it also includes algorithms that provide a secure mechanism for electronic collaboration that does not rely upon a central authority for the assets to be trusted [@uk_government_chief_scientific_adviser_distributed_2015]. That includes the concept of smart contracts, which is the ability of blockchains to execute autonomous scripts that can represent verifiable application logic and help automate a system’s rule set.

In my recently published paper, Socialism and the Blockchain [@huckle_socialism_2016], I find that most of the social and political narrative around BTC (and in their turn, blockchains) concentrates on a Libertarian viewpoint, which is an ideology that advocates individual freedom and minimal state intervention in people’s lives. However, I argue that blockchains can equally apply to Socialism, which is an economic theory and form of governance that advocates community ownership. Indeed, governmental institutions are beginning to examine blockchains as they recognise that some of a blockchain’s properties may have implications that extend beyond BTCs reach to economics and into social, political and humanitarian domains [@swan_blockchain:_2015].

My paper uses political theories as a means of explaining the technology. However, this may be a form of ‘coded governance’ of the type examined by Scott in How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance? [@brett_scott_how_2016], where he questions ‘techno-evangelism’. In particular, Scott looks at the dynamics of the Silicon Valley mantra: “In cryptography we trust.” He asks whether the BTC Libertarian narrative is just a form of “Techno-Colonial Solutionism”; the idea that technology, such as BTC, is an apolitical problem-solving mechanism whereby everything is either a problem already solved, or a problem to be solved by technology-driven organisations [@brett_scott_how_2016].

Is Scott correct or can technology, such as blockchains, actually offer solutions to, for example, the extreme poverty of Sub-Saharan Africa or the over-arching hyper-Capitalist models provided by the likes of Uber, which many regard as exploitative? In short, can technology be the basis for a fairer society? That question forms the basis for my research.

## What Information Do I Need to Answer My Research Question?

My research question is, currently, very broad. Indeed, to answer it, I am going to have to draw information from fields as wide-ranging as sociology, technology, politics, economics and ethics. This is so because of the nature technology I am researching, which some commentators predict will have a profound effect on society [@swan_blockchain:_2015]. Furthermore, Gower tells us this: "What we know is influenced by and perhaps determined by socio-economic forces" [@gower_scientific_1997]. Thus, I feel such a wide-ranging approach to my research is justified. However, therein also lies danger because it may be too broad. After all, as the author Alexandre Dumas put it: "All generalizations are dangerous, even this one." [@deal_retiring_2007]. Therefore, I need to achieve some focus and be very prescriptive about my work. Hence, rather than, at this stage, detailing what information I need, it might be more useful to address how I intend gathering the information required to answer my question and keep the scope of my research manageable. To do so, I propose using an agile, project-oriented, strategy based on scientific methods. For justification, I am going to appeal to Popper, who described science as comprising of means of rational discussion based on a clearly stated hypothesis and critical examination of solutions [@popper_logic_2002]. Such a logical approach to research is my intention within my work. 

## How Will I Get That Information?

Rather than explicitly listing the disparate sources of information I will be able to use for my research, such as the University of Sussex's access to digital copies of academic papers via Scopus or my ability to keep up to date with the current state of blockchain technology via targeted keywords in Google Alerts [@google_google_2016], I thought I should outline my approach to my research, which will help focus my quest for information relative to my work. 

As already discussed, even though some of my work will encompass social research, I am going to use scientific methods to help my answer my question. Indeed, I am going to enlist the broad approach described during a lecture on Research Methods [@peter_cheng_scientific_2016]. I am repeating it below using pseudo code:

    while [PhD]
    do
      Ask a question
        Why is the question relevant?
        Perform a literature review
      Frame a hypothesis
        Base the hypothesis on specific literature
        Express it in terms of the operations used for proof
      Derive a prediction and create the technology
        Build models and prototypes
      Gather evidence
        Create and run an experiment, making observations
        Test the technology
      Evaluate the hypothesis against evidence
        Interpret results for validity and scope
      Disseminate findings
    done

To provide more detail of how my research will proceed, I will now ellicit each major task listed in the pseudo code above.

### Ask a question

I have already written an extensive literature review concerning the technical aspects of blockchains. Furthermore, I have also covered some of the political and economic aspects of the technology in a paper I have had published [@huckle_socialism_2016]. However, to provide greater clarity to my research question, I still need to include more of the social and ethical aspects of my research.

### Frame a hypothesis

Broadly, my hypothesis is shaping up to be something along the lines of: "Although blockchains may provide the technical basis upon which people could easily interact with distant strangers and collaborate at scale, there are significant social, ethical, and political barriers to their adoption." I will need to provide extensive literature references as proof of that hypothesis and the emergence of Digital Autonomous Organisations (DAO) [@slock.it_slock.it_2015] should provide excellent background material for that section of my research.

### Create the technology

Fortunately, many examples of DAO technology exist as open source projects. Perhaps the best known of those is Slockit's _The DAO_ [@slock.it_github_2016], which, in May 2016, became the largest crowdfunding campaign in history (but which failed due to a vulnerability in its codebase that was exploited by a hacker [@david_siegel_understanding_2016]). Such resources are a great source for deriving working technical models for creating the technology required.

### Gather evidence and evaluate the hypothesis against evidence

Blockchains are new technology, so gathering evidence for proving my work may be somewhat challenging and assessing the hypothesis while lacking proof could be even more problematic. That section of my research will need careful and critical consideration.

### Disseminate findings

I am aiming to disseminate my results incrementally; that is to say, I am going to try and publish papers regularly throughout my PhD studies. The intention is to minimise the effort required for the final write up; or, as one of the lecturers in my office put it: "You'll be able to staple together your published papers and hand them in as your thesis." He wasn't entirely serious, but I got the message; I am aiming to have a good few published papers listed at the front of my thesis to aid the defence of my work during its final review.

## How will I Know That the Information Is Valid and Reliable?

Once again, I will defer to Popper to provide the _traditional_ view of validating information while employing the scientific method for research: "a scientist, whether theorist or experimenter, puts forward statements, or systems of statements, and tests them step by step. In the field of the empirical sciences, more particularly, he constructs hypotheses, or systems of theories, and tests them against experience by observation and experiment" [@popper_logic_2002]. While part of my work will involve technology and, therefore, necessarily include testing and experimentation, a good deal more, that which requires social research, may well encompass theorising and an examination of observations. Such study will lead to many conclusions. Four basic types of logical relation will determine the validity of those findings:

1. System consistency tested through a comparison of the findings 
2. The investigation of the logical form of the theories to determine their character 
3. A comparison with other theories
4. An empirical application of the conclusions based on possible experience, which must represent an obvious, plausible explanation of the events observed [@popper_logic_2002]. 

Given the social research nature of my research, Gower's description of the social character of the conclusions elicited by Popper above, and the criticism often made of them, seems wholly appropriate. He describes the objections thus: "Are the conclusions which are established by using scientific methods determined less by reason than by the social, political and economic environment within which the methods are endorsed?" [@gower_scientific_1997]. Gower dismisses such concerns; he describes the exploratory character of science and that experimentation can come from a variety of sources. Indeed, Gower writes that testing hypothesis involves identifying, stabilising and characterising natural phenomena, which requires initiative and skill based on a comprehensive, consistent approach to the scientific method, not an adherence to the idea that all science must, necessarily, involve experimentation derived within a laboratory environment. He does then, gives further credence to my choice of the scientific method for carrying out my research and the use of its tools when validating my findings.
