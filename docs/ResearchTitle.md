# Are Blockchain Systems the Basis Upon Which People Can Easily Interact With Distant Strangers and Collaborate at Scale?

Bitcoin (BTC) is a form of electronic cash that is referred to as cryptocurrency because it relies on cryptography. Blockchain is the technology underpinning BTC; it provides an immutable database, or public ledger, of every BTC transaction that has ever taken place. However, a blockchain has capabilities far beyond any standard database because it also includes algorithms that provide a secure mechanism for electronic collaboration that does not rely upon a central authority for the assets to be trusted [@uk_government_chief_scientific_adviser_distributed_2015]. That includes the concept of smart contracts, which is the ability of blockchains to execute autonomous scripts that can represent verifiable application logic and help automate a system’s rule set.

In my recently published paper, Socialism and the Blockchain [@huckle_socialism_2016], I find that most of the social and political narrative around BTC (and in their turn, blockchains) concentrates on a Libertarian viewpoint, which is an ideology that advocates individual freedom and minimal state intervention in people’s lives. However, I argue that blockchains can equally apply to Socialism, which is an economic theory and form of governance that advocates community ownership. Indeed, governmental institutions are beginning to examine blockchains as they recognise that some of a blockchain’s properties may have implications that extend beyond BTCs reach to economics and into social, political and humanitarian domains [@swan_blockchain:_2015].

My paper uses political theories as a means of explaining the technology. However, this may be a form of ‘coded governance’ of the type examined by Scott in How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance? [@brett_scott_how_2016], where he questions ‘techno-evangelism’. In particular, Scott looks at the dynamics of the Silicon Valley mantra: “In cryptography we trust.” He asks whether the BTC Libertarian narrative is just a form of “Techno-Colonial Solutionism”; the idea that technology, such as BTC, is an apolitical problem-solving mechanism whereby everything is either a problem already solved, or a problem to be solved by technology-driven organisations [@brett_scott_how_2016].

Is Scott correct or can technology, such as blockchains, actually offer solutions to, for example, the extreme poverty of Sub-Saharan Africa or the over-arching hyper-Capitalist models provided by the likes of Uber, which many regard as exploitative? In short, can technology be the basis for a fairer society? That question forms the basis for my research.

## What Information Do I Need to Answer My Research Question?

My research question is, currently, very broad. It covers social, technical, political, economic and ethical topics and therein lies some pitfalls; is the research question too broad? After all, as the author Alexandre Dumas put it: "All generalizations are dangerous, even this one." [@deal_retiring_2007]. Therefore, I must be mindful of keeping the scope of my research question manageable. To do that, I feel I must be prescriptive about my work and approach it in a project-oriented manner. Hence, rather than, at this stage, asking what information do I need, it might be more useful to address how I envisage proceeding in order to gather the information required to answer my question. I propose using an agile, project-oriented, approach and addressing my question using scientific methods, even though some of my work borders on social research. For justification as to why I propose using scientific methods, I am going to appeal to Popper, who described science as comprising of methods of rational discussion whereby hypothesis are clearly stated and solutions examined critically [@popper_logic_2002]. That's exactly my intention here. Hence, I am going to borrow the broad outline of the scientifc method as described during a lecture on the Research Methods course, repeated here using pseudo code:

    while [PhD]
    do
      Ask a question
        Why is the question important?
        Perform a literature review
      Frame a hypothesis
        Base the hypothesis on specific literature
        Express it in terms of the operations used for proof
      Derive a prediction and create the technology
        Build models and prototypes
      Gather evidence
        Create and run an experiment, making observations
        Test the technology
      Evaluate the hypothesis against evidence
        Interpret results for validity and scope
      Disseminate findings
    done

I shall now address each task listed above.

### Ask a question

I have already conducted an extensive literature review concerning the technical aspects of blockchains. Furthermore, I have also covered some of the political and economic aspects of the technology. However, I still need to include more of the social and ethical aspects of my research.

### Frame a hypothesis

Broadly, my hypothesis is shaping up to be something along the lines of: "Although blockchains may provide the technical basis upon which people could easily interact with distant strangers and collaborate at scale, there are significant social, ethical, and political barriers to their adoption." I will need to provide extensive literature references as proof of that hypothesis and the emergence of Digital Autonomous Organisations (DAO) [@slock.it_slock.it_2015] will provide excellent background material for that section of my research.

### Create the technology

Fortunately, many examples of DAO technology exist as open source projects. Perhaps the best known of those is Slockit's The DAO [@slock.it_github_2016], which, in May 2016, became the largest crowdfunding campaign in history (but which failed due to a vulnerability in its codebase that was exploited by a hacker [@david_siegel_understanding_2016]). Such resources are a great source for deriving working technical models for creating the technology required.

### Gather evidence and evaluate the hypothesis against evidence

Blockchains are new technology, so gathering evidence for proofing my hypothesis may be somewhat challenging and assessing the hypothesis in the wake of a lack of proof may be even more problematic. That section of my research will need to be conducted carefully and, as Popper suggests, critically.

### Disseminate findings

I am aiming to disseminate my results incrementally; that is to say, I am going to try and publish papers regularly throughout my PhD studies. Hopefully, that will minimise the effort required for the final write up; or, as one of the lecturers in my office put it: "You'll be able to staple together your published papers and hand them in as your thesis." He wasn't entirely serious, but I got the message;  I am aiming to have a good few published papers listed at the front of my thesis to aid the defence of my work during its final review.
